Upstream credits [LIVI](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI) and [Showcase](https://github.com/amineross/showcase) for protocol research. Existing source comments and attribution are preserved.

## Native call echo cancellation

The project vendors a subset of [SpeexDSP 1.2.1](https://github.com/xiph/speexdsp/tree/SpeexDSP-1.2.1) from Xiph.org Foundation and its contributors, including the acoustic echo canceller, preprocessor and FFT/filterbank support. It is compiled into `libspeex_echo.so` for the optional experimental **Call echo cancellation** feature.

SpeexDSP uses a BSD-style three-clause license. The full copyright notices, redistribution conditions and disclaimer are retained in [the vendored COPYING file](../shared/src/main/jni/speexdsp/COPYING). Component source headers retain their additional notices, including KISS FFT's Mark Borgerding attribution. The [vendoring notes](../shared/src/main/jni/speexdsp/README.md) identify the source version and build configuration.

## Authentication assets

The source repository does not include accessory authentication keys or Android APK-signing keys. A standalone build requires explicit, locally supplied authentication assets. Any such assets packaged in an APK can be extracted from that APK and are not relicensed by this project. Use and distribute only assets you are authorized to use.

## Project website

The DiPlay-Nissan project page uses its own simplified Chinese layout and stylesheet. The original DiAuto attribution for the app settings interface remains above.
